# NxWindows
This software, coded in Python using PowerShell, will allow you to activate Windows 10 and 11 on your computer. There's nothing to do; just click a button and you're done.

# Informations

The script needs administrator rights to execute shell commands, so you have to run the executable as administrator for it to work.
Speaking of which, if you don't trust me, that's your problem, I share my projects, it's up to you to believe me or not :)

# Downloads

The size limit on GitHub in M ​​is 25, so I can't share the executable with you directly.
That's why I'm making a drive for you directly.
If you have any problems using the software, you'll find what you need in # Help

download : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HULi2YXAuCwp277K0KBT1R2hDVoddnzC/view?usp=sharing


# Help 

if you have error at the start of the app, you can install python on this website : https://python.org/downloads
then when you are on the python installer, make sure you coch the "add to path" button.
after this, you can open a cmd in administrator and run this command : pip install tkinter customtkinter psutil keyboard pywin32 webbrowser winreg


after this, if that doesn't work, i can't help you, sorry :(
